## 1.x

 * Removed xlsblock, xlsinclude and xlsmacro. The native Twig functions do work now like they are supposed to do!
 * Removed explicitValue cell property. Use dataType instead. However PhpSpread is handling leading zeros properly now so you probably don't have to use this property anyway.
 * Changed header/footer types. Just use 'even', 'odd', 'first' now.
